# Project Context

## Project Name
PMD Proposal Client Consumer

## What This Project Does
A Kafka-based event consumer service that processes incoming proposal client requests. It validates business rules, enriches data with domain logic, and publishes processed events for downstream consumption.

## Architecture
Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

## Layer Structure
- `domain/` - Pure business logic (no framework dependencies)
- `application/` - Use cases, ports (in/out), orchestration services
- `infrastructure/` - Adapters for Kafka (in/out), DTOs, mappers, configs

## Key Architectural Rules
1. Domain layer must remain framework-agnostic (no Spring annotations)
2. Business logic goes in domain models or domain services
3. Application services only orchestrate (no business logic)
4. Adapters handle DTO ↔ Domain mapping
5. Input adapters CALL input ports
6. Output adapters IMPLEMENT output ports

## Technologies
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 4.0.2
- Spring Kafka
- Maven
- Lombok (infrastructure only)

## Important Files
- `ABOUT.md` - Project overview and layer explanations
- `README.md` - Quick start guide

## Current State
- Kafka consumer receives ProposalClientEvent
- Domain model validates and applies business rules
- Domain service provides multi-entity logic (priority, team assignment)
- Output adapter publishes to external Kafka topic

## Future TODOs (from comments in code)
1. Check if client is already saved in DB
2. If not saved, save it
3. Generate UUID for proposal and save in DB
4. Send event to external service with proposal
